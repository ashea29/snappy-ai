# Snappy AI

A simple app to interact with the "text-curie-001" GPT-3 AI engine from OpenAI. Built for Shopify's Front End Developer Intern Challenge. Connects to a Firebase Cloud Function HTTP server ([check out the repo here](https://github.com/ashea29/snappy-ai-api)) with a single POST endpoint (in order to hide the OpenAI API key) which in turn calls the OpenAI API and returns the AI engine's response to the user prompt. 

## Usage

Just type a prompt in the box, and wait for Snappy (the name I chose for the AI) to respond!
